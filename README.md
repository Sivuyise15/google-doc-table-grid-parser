# google-doc-table-grid-parser
This code fetches the HTML content from a published Google Doc URL and extracts table cell data from it. It cleans the extracted data by removing any HTML tags and then groups the cleaned cells into triples representing x-cod, characters, and y-cod. It builds a 2D grid based on the max x, y values and places each character in its correct position.
